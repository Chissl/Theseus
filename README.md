This mod adds Theseus, a custom Hero tower that excels at boss events with his array of laser weapons.

Tips:

Theseus levels slowly, so it is advised to use your extra money to level him up.

Theseus causes boss bloons to take more damage, so set his targeting to strong when a boss in on screen and in range.

Theseus's orbital strike can clear entire waves of bloons if its targeting and timing is correct.

Theseus gains extra cash per pop (x2 from lvl 1-8 and x4 at lvl 9+), so make sure he is getting as many pops as possible.

Contact Chiss#5306 on Discord if you have suggestions or feedback about the hero!
